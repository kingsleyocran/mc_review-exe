      The second-generation Toyota GR86 is completely new for the 2022 model
      year, and it follows the same rear-wheel-drive formula as the first-gen
      car. Developed again in conjunction with the Subaru BRZ, the 2022 GR86
      will be powered by a horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine and a
      standard six-speed manual transmission. This time around, Toyota has
      addressed our principal complaint with the last generation and has given
      the GR86 more horsepower for 2022. The new model is powered by a 2.4-liter
      horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine that makes 228 horsepower, which
      is 23 hp more than the outgoing model's 2.0-liter mill. The result is a
      phenomenal driving experience for the price, a combo that's worthy of
      spots on our 10Best and Editors' Choice lists.
